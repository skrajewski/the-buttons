        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            It's not an another pretty awesome CSS framework with many features and lots possibilities. It's not a set of magic CSS classes to solve every problem which you have with HTML and CSS at your work. It's not a ready-to-use CSS library. It's just an idea with a simple prototype to show how to design a maintainable, useful and good-looking component such as, in this case - <strong>button</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="my-thought">
            <p>
                I'm not hiding that I was strong inspiring by <em>Material Design</em> by Google and other CSS Framework such as <em>Bootstrap</em> or <em>Foundation</em>. I focus on buttons only, because I would like to show how a considered start with a new project may bring many benefits in future.
            </p>

        <h2>Why buttons?</h2>

        <p>
            Besides content, buttons are very important because they encourage people to interact with the website or with the web application. Similar to a real world, when We see a button, we expect some action on pressing it. But there is one big difference between physical buttons and virtual buttons. First of them give a user a natural, physical <strong>feedback</strong> such as <em>click</em> sound, press or something else. We can touch this button, feel it, press strongly or slightly. Virtual buttons must be programmed to emit an artificial feedback to the user, and We, as web developers are responsible for doing it right.
        </p>

        <h1>Explore</h1>

        <p>The main purpose was redesigned an ugly, native browser button to fresh, modern and good-looking equivalent. It has custom behavior such as focus, hover, and active and should works fine with many other components and elements such as tables, cards, messages, etc.</p>

        <div class="center" style="margin: 40px 0;">
            <button class="button button-filled button-success button-large">Explore this project</button>
        </div>

        <p>
            I would like to encourage you to explore my experiments with buttons. My goal was to prototype a button which could be use in many places on the website. I don't finish yet, but current state of this project makes me happy.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                It's not an another pretty awesome CSS framework with many features and lots possibilities. It's not a set of magic CSS classes to solve every problem which you have with HTML and CSS at your work. It's not a ready-to-use CSS library. It's just an idea with a simple prototype to show how to design a maintainable, useful and good-looking component such as, in this case - <strong>button</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="my-thought">
                <p>
                    I'm not hiding that I was strong inspiring by <em>Material Design</em> by Google and other CSS Framework such as <em>Bootstrap</em> or <em>Foundation</em>. I focus on buttons only, because I would like to show how a considered start with a new project may bring many benefits in future.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why buttons?</h2>

            <p>
                Besides content, buttons are very important because they encourage people to interact with the website or with the web application. Similar to a real world, when We see a button, we expect some action on pressing it. But there is one big difference between physical buttons and virtual buttons. First of them give a user a natural, physical <strong>feedback</strong> such as <em>click</em> sound, press or something else. We can touch this button, feel it, press strongly or slightly. Virtual buttons must be programmed to emit an artificial feedback to the user, and We, as web developers are responsible for doing it right.
            </p>

            <h1>Prototype button</h1>

            <p>The main purpose was redesigned an ugly native, browser button to fresh, modern and good-looking equivalent. It has custom behavior such as focus, hover, and active.</p>

            <div class="row center">
                <div class="col v-center">
                    <button>Basic button</button>
                </div>
                <div class="col v-center">
                    <button class="button">New button</button>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                As you can see, although a new button is fresher and better styled than a native button, it still looks boring and not interested. But together with new style, I introduced a few CSS classes which could modify final appearance.
            </p>

            <div class="center" style="padding: 50px 0;">
                <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button">Normal button</button>
                <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-filled">Filled button</button>
                <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-light">Light button</button>
            </div>

            <p>Looks good, but these buttons suffer for lack of meaning...</p>

            <h2>Colors</h2>

            <p>Colors are everywhere. They are meaningful and eye-catching. If you see, e.g. red color you'll expect an important information or an action. Green could mean success, but orange - warning. Let add some colors to buttons...</p>

            <ul class="color-list">
                <li><div class="color color-success"></div> Success</li>
                <li><div class="color color-warning"></div> Warning</li>
                <li><div class="color color-danger"></div> Danger</li>
                <li><div class="color color-secondary"></div> Secondary</li>
            </ul>

                    =
                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-success">Button</button>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-filled">Button</button>

                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-warning button-filled">Button</button>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-light">Button</button>
                    +
                    <div class="color color-danger"></div>
                    =
                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-danger button-light">Button</button>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-filled">Button</button>
                    +
                    <div class="color color-secondary"></div>
                    =
                    <button style="margin: 0 10px;" class="button button-secondary button-filled">Button</button>
                </div>

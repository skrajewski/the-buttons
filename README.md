This repository contains **The Button Project**. In short, it's my simple experiment with HTML Buttons, the SASS technology, and a little different approach to writing CSS components.

I tried to refresh native browser buttons by creating a highly modularize and customizable equivalents. They have much more variants, modifications, and features.

What is my purpose?
- easy provides new types of buttons
- appearance modification by CSS classes
- pretty `hover`, `focus`, `active`, `disabled` states
- facilities for people with color blindness
